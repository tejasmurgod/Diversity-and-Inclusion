Diversity and Inclusion Analysis
Problem Statement
Human Resources at our telecom client is committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion, particularly in improving gender balance at the executive management level. Despite concerted efforts, progress in this area has been slow. PwC Switzerland has been approached for support in addressing this challenge, recognizing diversity and inclusion as critical business imperatives.

Steps Followed
Data Collection: Gathered relevant data on employee demographics, promotions, performance ratings, and turnover from the telecom client's HR database.

Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved handling missing values, outlier detection, and data validation.

KPI Definition: Defined key performance indicators (KPIs) related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover that align with diversity and inclusion goals.

Visualisation Creation: Developed visualizations to represent the defined KPIs in an intuitive and informative manner. These visualizations provide insights into gender distribution, promotion rates, performance ratings, and turnover trends.

Dashboard Design: Designed a user-friendly dashboard using Power BI, incorporating interactive elements and drill-down capabilities to allow for deeper analysis and exploration of data.

Dashboard Testing: Conducted rigorous testing to ensure the functionality, responsiveness, and accuracy of the dashboard. Feedback from stakeholders was incorporated to refine and improve the dashboard.

Dashboard Deployment: Deployed the dashboard to the Power BI Service, making it accessible to HR professionals and decision-makers for ongoing monitoring and analysis.

Insights
Gender Distribution: The analysis revealed the current gender distribution within the organization, highlighting the proportion of men and women across different levels and departments.

Promotion Rates: Examined the percentage of employees promoted in the fiscal year 2021, as well as the percentage of women promoted relative to men. Disparities in promotion rates between genders may indicate potential barriers to advancement for women.

Hiring Practices: Analyzed the percentage of male and female hires to assess the organization's commitment to gender diversity in recruitment efforts.

Turnover Trends: Explored turnover rates to identify any patterns or trends that may contribute to gender imbalances within the workforce.

Performance Ratings: Evaluated the average performance ratings for men and women to understand if there are disparities in how performance is assessed and rewarded.

Root Causes of Slow Progress
Unconscious Bias: Despite efforts to promote diversity and inclusion, unconscious biases may still exist in the hiring, promotion, and performance evaluation processes, resulting in gender disparities.

Lack of Mentorship and Sponsorship: Women may face challenges in accessing mentorship and sponsorship opportunities, which are crucial for career advancement and visibility within the organization.

Limited Leadership Commitment: The lack of visible leadership commitment to diversity and inclusion initiatives may hinder progress, as employees may perceive these efforts as superficial or insincere.

Inflexible Work Policies: Work policies that do not accommodate the needs of caregivers, predominantly women, may contribute to attrition rates among female employees, particularly at senior levels.

Male-Dominated Culture: A male-dominated corporate culture may create barriers for women to thrive and advance within the organization, leading to a lack of representation at the executive management level.

Conclusion
The Diversity and Inclusion Analysis Dashboard provides valuable insights into gender diversity metrics and identifies potential barriers to progress within the organization. By addressing root causes such as unconscious bias, lack of mentorship, and inflexible work policies, the telecom client can accelerate progress towards achieving gender balance at all levels of the organization.
